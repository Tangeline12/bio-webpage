	<p>I like to watch a ton of television, television is my life. This is my last year of highschool and my very last year at In-Tech Academy. I have meet new people, old people, people that I've stopped talking to, people that I have rekindled my relationship with. Highschool was fun while it lasted but I am so ready for college. Hobbies that I enjoy doing is volleyball, traveling, eating new foods, meeting new people, and learning.
